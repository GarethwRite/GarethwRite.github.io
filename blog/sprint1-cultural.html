<h5>My Personal Values</h5>

<p>Its always a struggle to reflect on ones self and their motivations, what drives them to succeed, and what principles define them.
For me I hold family and security very high, i wish to succeed in my dreams to help many people, most important to me is my family, but depending on 
how financially successful i am i would love to help the world. My dreams motivated me to keep going and to venture down certain paths 
and all of which had led me here. I had dreams to travel so i made it happen and didnt let anyone hold me back,it meant i had to sacrafice and work hard,
 the same goes for my current dreams but these are on a far bigger magnitue and the learning hurdles are much greater in comparison to saving money to live in the UK for
a few years, but that doesnt sway me, theres a saying that goes something like "successful people have failed the most times because there
not affraid to take the risk, and failing is a the best way to learn and evolve". I was bought up in a large traditional kiwi home, fish aand chip fridays 
and roast on sundays with the family, my upbringing on reflection is clear where my family values and identity stem from.</p>

<h5>My Strengths and limitations</h5>

<p>Being goal oreinted is definately a major strength of mine, its also comes as a package of strengths because to to have big goals then you must be patient, dilligent, focused, mentally strong
because there are days where nothing will work and you just have to breathe, relax and try again and again... </p>

<p>Limitations are something i honestly try not to even think they exsist. to have a list of limitations which im sure i am limited to certain things but i dont know what my limitations are. 
I'd like to think there are no limitations for anyone, but this isnt true, i cannot be a pilot because of color blindness, but the path im a choosing i aim for little to no limits at all.</p>

<p>An example of tension while trying to work productively for me is. While studying at otago uni I had a part time job as a cleaner, there was a lady named sally, bad mouthed everybody behind their
back and she would claim we where not doing their job to an acceptable standard. the stratigies i used to work with her was to be nice and polite
and when she bad mouthed another employee on there work i would say quite the opposite like "she does a great job cleaning the bathrooms". on reflection i think i was a little to passive i should have
told her i did not appreciate her talking that way about others and remind her that we are all humans and we all are not perfect. </p>
