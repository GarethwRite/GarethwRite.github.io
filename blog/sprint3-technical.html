            <h5>An analogy for the differences between html and css</h5>

            <p>Think of a person, html is the main content like the arms,body head and legs and css is the the visual styling of the 
                person e.g. jeans, hat, jacket. So simply put html is the main content of a webpage and css is responsible for the layout 
                and styling of the webpage.
            </p>

            <h5>Control flow and loops explained</h5>

            <p>control flow is basically as it is named, control flow is the order in which code is executed in javascript.
              Loops are a block of code that is executed a number of times until the loop ends or a certain output is reached
              depending on the code.
            </p>

            <h5>What is the DOM?</h5>

            <p>The DOM(document object model) is a representation of a web page in a tree like structure where objects or elements
              are displayed in a hierarchy starting at the root directory, it is a useful way to display and minipulate and access elements.
            </p>

            <h5>Whats the difference between accesing data from arrays and objects?</h5>

            <p>the difference is that an object should be thought of as a thing like a person and building, these are made up of many characteristics
              where as data is not a thing like a person, data could be the age or height, both are mutable. </p>

            <h5>What are functions and what are they good for?</h5>

            <p>A function is a block of code made to prefom a specific task, they are very useful for altering a webpage after it has 
              been loaded, making a website more interactive.
