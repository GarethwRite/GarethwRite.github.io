          <h4>Journal: What suprised me most about core learning?</h4>

          <p>I am most surprised about the great potential of the core learning
              , I myslef have not yet mastered all the consepts but i dont thnk that
              is needed, i will take out what works for me like in the learning plan 
              and implement other ideas for growth mindset etc, the abiltity to shape 
              my mind and knowing now i can learn what i want is a great and surprising 
              feeling. its surprising because you think some of the core learning ideas
              seem like common sense but when reading your like "well duh thats obvious"
              but then reflecting and being like "hmm well i get that but why arnt i doing that".
          </p>

          <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>

          <p>I learnt that i dont know as much about coding concepts as i thought, or i had forgotten alot 
              between coding full time at uni, so without regularly coding its easy to lose those skills
          </p>

          <p>I learnt through core that understanding when im stressed or stuck i am the least effective at coding, its like a 
              wall i cant cross until i calm down and clear the mind to solve the problem.
          </p>

          <p>I learnt i had a few core strengths that are inherent with my personality, like growth mindset and planning</p>

          <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>

          <p>In programming they are very important, because coding is continous problem solving its highly effective to have 
              awareness of yourself to monitor, so you know if your tired stressed or sad, it gives you the abiltity to change those 
              emotions and use them for good.
          </p>

          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

          <p>for me the most challenging thing was acknowledging my weaknesses, as its somthing i tend to avoid, but now i know that acknowledging
              strengths and weaknesses is a good thing because then you can make changes or adapt to suit yourself.
          </p>

          <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>

          <p>I think you do it because it sets us students up with great a foundation to build and learn ourselves as well as being able to work with others
              effectively, which will not only help us in solving problems/ being able to think, but also help us in the real working world as developers.
          </p>

          <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer</h4>

          <p>No i dont think so, because we could learn how to code until the cows come home but there will be times when were stuck and
            confused and irratated but the core skills we learn i think will counter that and in turn will make us better programmers/ developers.
          </p>

          <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>g

          <p>I hope to use the skills i learn from the Dev Academy to
              create apps and game ideas i have, I want to have my own studio
              that creates great games and apps the entertain and help people 
              in the world, while providing me a decent lifestyle to enjoy what i am
              doing and what i want to do.
          </p>

          <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>

          <p>my biggest strength to help me is my goals and abition to achieving my dreams</p>

          <p>my weakness ive found is my ability to slow things down and look at little pieces 
              at a time to make the whole picture, compared to thinking about the big picture and not knowing how to get three
              and then stressing and getting mad over it.
             </p>

          <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>

          <p>The change in routine and lifestyle adjustment. I have pretty standard routines on how i go about my day, so moving to a new
              place flips that routine on its head, so adjustment, and fast adjustment so i do not fall behind in the course will be the biggest challenge 
              i can think of at the moment but it may be something completely different because im a not in wellington yet so i cannot account for all
               the unknown variables.
          </p>

          <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>

          <p>how and where will i seek help in a timely way?, I will be constantly asking questions in classes if i am unclear and i plan to journal everyday with a reflection
              piece that i rite down all issues i am struggling with and bring them to a teacher in the one on one sessions. I expect myself to put in 110% for reasons like, 
              this course is not cheap so make sure i get my moneys worth out of the teachers and facilitators, i expect myself to grow as person to develop healthy habbits
              that ill use in daily life, not just coding, example "i currently smoke cigarettes and i dont want to by the end of this course", people say succcess is the sum of a lot 
              of small habbits put into practice over and over until thats the normal, i want to achieve on a high level all the time and i hope this course can help.
