          <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>

<p>discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?</p>

<p>it benefits people becacuse it allows them to realise that their brain is not fixed, that it can change and learn new skills no matter what the individual thinks.</p>

<p>discuss how you might engage with the pricipals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</p>

<p>for me it was quite good to read and understand that are brains can mould and we can create strong pathways for learning code, practice, practice, practice is the key thing i found to strengthen
    the signals and ideally create faster repsonse times while solving problems, but also just the knowing i can strengthen skills via neuroplasticity techniques is a reward in it self</p>
    

<p>what are some aways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
<ol>
    <li class="simple">practice and repition</li>
    <li class="simple">good quality sleep(resets brain connections that are important for memory and learning)</li>
    <li class="simple">strong purpose for what your learning</li>
    <li class="simple">little to no stress</li>
    <li class="simple">learn a new language</li>
</ol>

<p>Growth mindset</p>
 
<p>what is it and why is it relavant?</p>

<p>A growth mindset is when people think that their abilities basic or new can be developed through 
    dedication and hardwork, this idea creates strong will and determination to push towards goals 
    and makes the individual feel full control in their life, its relavance is simple, its relavant
    because it creates happier stronger people more willing to try harder obstacles in life to achieve </p>

    <p>what the individual wants out of life.?</p>

<p>during this exploratiion nothing really surprised me, I believe that i do have a good Growth mindset, i would almost take a growth mindset to be a positive attitude in life.
    what would surprise me is if only a minority of people take on the growth mindset atitude, im sure its inherent for some and learned by others but the world would be a lovely 
    place if everyone had a growth mindset.</p>

<p>How will i implement growth mindset into my learning journey?</p>

<p>I will intergrate some of the techniques to develop growth mindset, like trying to learn different learning tatics, viewing
    challenges as oppertunites, valuing the process instead of end result. and find plenty of time for reflection.</p>
